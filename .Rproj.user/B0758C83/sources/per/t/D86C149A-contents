## 1. Introduction

The primary aim of this course is to provide participants with essential tools for effective data exploration and the creation of custom sequences and commands. Over the duration of the course, we will comprehensively examine frequently employed commands and objects in the realm of data analysis, employing two programming languages: R and Bash. After a brief introduction to both languages, accompanied by a clarification of their differences, the course will pivot towards the hands-on resolution of real-world examples, specifically emphasizing data description and manipulation. This practical approach ensures that participants gain tangible skills applicable to authentic data scenarios.

## 2.	Objectives

The course objectives can be summarized into three main points:

1. **Command Proficiency:** Attaining proficiency in fundamental terminal commands and command-line operations.

2. **Programming Fundamentals:** Grasping the basic concepts and functions of programming in both R and Bash.

3. **Practical Application:** Effectively resolving exercises in both programming languages, fostering hands-on experience and skill development.


## 3. Program

1. **Declaration and Utilization of Variables**

  Understanding the declaration and effective utilization of variables in programming contexts.

2. **Basic Database Handling**

  Developing foundational skills in the basic manipulation of databases, emphasizing practical applications.


3. **Application of Conditionals and Loops**

  Exploring the use of conditionals and loops to enhance control flow in program execution.

4. **Utilization of Functions and Scripts for Real-World Problem Solving**

  Leveraging functions and scripts to solve real-world examples, focusing on practical problem resolution within the context of actual cases.
